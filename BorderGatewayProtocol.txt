WHAT IS BGP -> border gateway protocol:

BGP is an inter-domain path-vector routing protocol.

It runs on TCP port 179.

Provides a reliable loop free routing between diffrent Autonomous Systems

Current version is BGP-4. It supports protocols for IPv4 & IPv6..

********************************************************************************************************

In BGP,

Routers = Speakers.

They form PEERing. Neighbour relationships with other BGP routers.

BGP that connect to other ASes are known as external BGP (eBGP).

RFCs ->
	BGP was first defined in RFC1105
	BGP-4 was published in 1995 in RFC1771
	
	BGP-4 remains the current version. But there's been additions. RFC 4270 (Published 2006) is the latest relevant standard.

Routing protocols classified depending on the way they store information on routes.

PATH - VECTOR  (BGP uses this)

PATH - DISTANCE

LINK - STATE

******************************************************************************************************

Format of AS Numbers. 

Prior to Janurary 2009, BGP autonomous system numbers that were allocated to companies were:
	2 octet numbers. 16 bits. Described in RFC 4271.

Due to increased demand for AS numbers, IANA started to allocate 4 octet 32 bit AS numbers.




RFCs allow for two diffrent represenations of these 2/4 octet numbers. 	-> 	Asplain	// Asdot

Private AS Number = 23456. Created in RFC 4893. Some vendors do not allow use of this AS number.


Asplain:
	Decimal value notation where AS numbers are represented by their decimal values.
	EG 2 byte = 65526
	EG 4 byte = 234567

Asdot:
	Two byte numbers represented by their decimal value.	EG 65526
	Four byte numbers are represented by their dot notation.	EG 1.169031

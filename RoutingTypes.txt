Each router needs a routing table to function.

They can be constructed Statically OR Dynamically

Static Routing:

	* Created, updated, maintained by the Network administrator.
	* Done through command line (Cisco IoS)
	* Every route on every router needs configured
	* Fine level of Control, but labour intensive
	* Difficult to keep static routes up to date
	* Can't cope with which router crashes / go offline.
	* Can't automatically choose a better route if one becomes avaliable

	-> Routers will not share static routes with each other. Reduces RAM / CPU overhead.
	-> Static routes have an administrative Distance AD of 1. 


Dyanmic Routing:

Created, maintained & updated by a routing protocol. Examples include:
	-> RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
	-> EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
	-> OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
	-> BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

Routers DO share dynamic routing information with each other. = Increased CPU / RAM overhead.

Routing protocols able of dynamically choosing the best path when routing infrastrucure changes.

Routing protocol = Dynamically builds the network, topology & next hop information in routing tables.

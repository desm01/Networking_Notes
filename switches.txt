The early version of Ethernet = Single cable. Terminator at each end. T connector in cable connects to PC Network Card.

More PCs = Very Slow & Unusable

ONE PC transmits at a time. If two transmit = collision. 
All other PCs need to be silent at one time.

More PCs = More data = Less time for each PC.

The first approach was an Ethernet bridge. -> Allowed LAN Segment to be scaled up.

In Bridge = PCs still have to compete for time, but segments don't compete with each other. === 	Bridges too expensive / (Add Latency)

Modern Solution = SWITCHES

***************************************************************************

* Every device connects to one port on the Switch. No delay in communication as single cable.
* Small delay in transmission - High performance devices
* Switch stores data in tables. MAC addresses stored in memory.

Advantages of two LANs joined by Router:
	Any LAN operates at layer 2, so here we have two (layer 2) networks joined at (layer 3). We therefore need a diffrent network address for each LAN.
	
	Within each LAN we have a broadcast domain at layer 2. All NICs can and will discover each other. With 2 -> domains small / low latency

	We can apply basic security rules on the router and limit the traffic that may cross from one LAN to another.
	I.E Block access to MySQL port 3306 from engineering

Negative:
	If you had five or ten LANs in a large company / uni; too expensive to buy equipment


VLAN:

Using one set of switches to run several diffrent LANs on the infrastrucutre. VIRTUAL LANs

the total number of ports (Over all switches) must be greater than or equal to the sum over number of PCs per LAN


Still common practice to allocate a DIFFRENT NETWORK ADDRESS to each LAN.

A Router is then used to route between diffrent VLANs running on the infrastrucutre as well as to other LANs and to the internet.

To enable VLANs we need to build a switching infrastrucure.
	Using MANAGED SWITCHES:
		Good idea to use the same manufacturer

A managed Switch is a device that can be congifured and properly managed to offer a more tailored experince to those who will be utilising it.
	Offer tools to manage, monitor network and traffic

Managed Switches can be seen as specialised computers having one or more command line interfaces. Accessed via shell, web interface or SNMP tools

The IEEE 802.1Q standard added a TAG field to the format. The VLAN tag!

********************** IMPORTANT
	At the Switch, the VLAN tag is added / removed. PC-a & PC-b are never aware of their VLAN.

	NIC on each PC recieves ordinary Ethernet Packets. All removal / adding of VLAN tags happens on Switches.

Traffic can not move from one VLAN to another inside the switch. We need to go to Layer 3 to ROUTE packets between VLANs

Each Pyshical port is assigned to one VLAN.

An UNMANAGED switch is a device that has no management interface.

	Some unmanaged swithces don't understand the presence of the VLAN tag and may drop the packet
	There is no way to configure a VLAN for each port on an unmanaged switch

	Mixing managed switches / unmanaged switches in one switching fabric could create chaos if VLANs are used

VLANs over multiple switches.
	We need several switches to be able to supply enough ports for all the PCs and printers in the building.
	Generally we would put a switch on each floor in a building.

In general we will have departments spread across several floors. Maybe the sales departments will have more employees than others etc.
	We can combine the switches on all floors togther to share their knowledge of VLANs called:	The VLAN database
		We configure certain ports on each switch as TRUNKING ports. We join the trunking ports together.

The switches exchange details with each other over their TRUNKING ports about the configuration of VLAN ports on that switch

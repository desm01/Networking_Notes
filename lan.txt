Local Communication:
* Eliminates duplication -> Sharing resources between other computers
* Technical & Economic Reasons -> Shared networks benefical for local communication
* Computers attached to shared network must co-ordinate to use Network Communication. LAN allows this
* The time required to communicate depends on distance
* A network spread over large distance = Long delays.

Significance of LAN:
* LAN = Inexpensive
* For computer science -> Success linked to the locaclity of reference principle

IF a pair of computers communicate = They're likely to communicate again in the near future.

A Computer tends to communicate most often with the computers that are nearby.

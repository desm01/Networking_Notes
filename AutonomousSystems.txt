Autonomous Systems:::

	What is the internet?

The internet is an almagam of individual IP Networks. These networks are known as AS.

Every AS connects to the internet through ISP.

ISPs can be seen as an AS

ISPs connect to each other through each countries IX (Internet Exchange)

London has an IXP etc, as does Dublin. 

*************************************************************************************************************************

	In some places ASes connect to each other.

An AS in Network X doesn't need to know the inner working of Network Y. Just needs the address of AS Y.

(Exterior Gateway Protocols) ->	Router at the edge of an AS tell others about itself.
(Interior Gateway Protocols) -> Router in AS talks to its own routers about itself.



UK University uses JANET as an ISP.


**************************************************************************************************************************

An Autonomous System is:

a COLLECTION of IP routing prefixes. (IPv4 Addresses)

under the CONTROL of one or more network operators. (Could be you??? Or an ISP or Business person)

act on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain. -> Presents a clearly defined routing policy to the internet

	FYI: -> CIDR BLOCK = IPv4 Address



EXAMPLE:

	143.117.0.0/22 	CIDR BLOCK

	Above network could represent several sub networks. 

	You present above IP to outside world through extrenal gateway.
	Let the router handle routing external packets through internal network.




Classic Definition:
	
	A set of routers under a single technical administration. Using an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS.
	And using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to other ASes.


New Definition:
	For a single AS to use several interior gateway protocols and diffrent metrics.
 
	An AS administartor appears to other ASes to have a single coherent interior routing plan.


**************************************************************************************************************************
Every AS has a globally unique number.

Sometimes refered to as ASN.

The number is used in both:
	The exchange of exterior routing information. (Between neighbouring ASes)
	As an identifier of the AS itself.

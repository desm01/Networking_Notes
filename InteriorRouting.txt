Interior Routing:	Inside the AS.

What is routing?


Finding the best way to route data from a certain point to another.

Routing Computation is distributed among the routers in a domain,

Finding the correct route (Best Hop) is the most CPU / Memory intensive task a router can do. (Many interior protocols) = Diffrent benefits and drawbacks

You can use Vectoring OR Link States

*****************************************************************************

Vectoring: -> 
	* Each routers knows little about the topology
	* Only the best NEXT hop is choosen. Not the best total route.
	* Doesn't need a uniform policy on all routers
	* No notion of distance. Just the next node in chain.
	* The compisition of the path from A-Z is formed from best possible hop at each node

Vectoring = RIP / BGP


****************************************************************************


Link State: ->
	* Topology information is FLOODED within the domain.
	* The BEST path is COMPUTED locally on each router
	* Best END-END paths determine hops
	* Tries to limit distance.
	* ONLY works if the policy is UNIFORM and all routers in the domain have a shared policy.

Link State = OSPF, IS-IS

***************************************************************************

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

* Each OSPF router on the network communicates with other neighbouring routers. 
* It establishes the state of all adjacent neighbours and gathers their neighbours.
* Every communication sequence is a seperate conversation identified by the pair of Router IDs of the communicating neighbours.


OSPF routers ADVERTISE their routing topology across the OSPF domain via Link State Advertising. These LSAs are sent in the form of Link State Updates between adjacent routers.

****************************************************************************

With OSPF a single AS is divided into smaller groups called areas. 

The backbone area is the core of the OSPF network. Every other area must be connected to the backbone area.


Much communication is between routers in the same area. This reduces overhead traffic sent on the network, and reduces size of the topology database that each router maintains.



AREA -> Logical collection of OSPF networks, routers & links that have the same AREA IDENTIFICATION.

A router within an AREA -> Must maintain topological database for the area to which it belongs. 
The router does not have detailed information about network topology outside its network.
= Therefore database size is reduced.

	Types of OSPF routers:
		* Backbone Router = Has atleast one of its interfaces in the backbone area.
		* Internal Router = Has all its interfaces in a single area.
		* Area Border Router (ABR) = An OSPF router that has one or more interfaces in the backbone area and one or more interfaces in a non-backbone area.
		* Autonomous System Border Control (ASBR) = Connects to an area and also to an external AS.



******************************************************************************

OSPF runs over IP DIRECTLY.

OSPF packets are encapsulated solely by IP & local data-link headers.

OSPF does not define a way to fragment its protocols packets and depends on IP fragmentation when transmitting packets larger than Network MTU.

* Length of packets can be up to 65,535 bytes (Including IP header)

OSPF packets:
	* Likely to be large. (Database Description Packets, Link)
	* State Request, Link State Update & Link State Acknoledgment
	* Packets can usually be split into several seperate protocol packets without loss of functionality

OSPF uses multicast.
	Broadcasts using IP 224.0.0.0 & 224.0.0.255
	These IPs assigned by IANA and designated for multicasting on local sub-net only.
	Time to live of multicasted packets set to 1. Ensures it says link-local.
